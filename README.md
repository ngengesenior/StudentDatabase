# StudentDatabase
A project that simulates the notion of a student database where 

1 There is an admin login screen for a login for access to the main screen.

2 The main screen contains a screen manager for
  i) Adding students
  
  ii) Deleting students
  
  iii) Searching students
  
  iv) Displaying all students

The model.py file can be run first to generate the database.
But an initial database is already in the project with some names

The admin name is  `admin` and the password is `password`.

The technologies used here are Python,Kivy and Plyer.Cython is required as well before
installation of Kivy.
